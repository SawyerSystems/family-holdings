# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
The Family Holdings application now implements proper role-based access control to ensure that each login is independent and users only have access to features appropriate to their role.

## User Roles and Access Levels

### Admin Users (Will Sawyer)
- **Email:** `admin@familyholdings.local`
- **Password:** `WillSawyer2024!`
- **Access Level:** Full admin privileges

**Available Features:**
- ✅ View all family member profiles
- ✅ Manage user borrowing limits (Manage buttons)
- ✅ Add/edit contributions for any member
- ✅ Process loan requests
- ✅ View comprehensive family statistics
- ✅ Family Overview page with management capabilities
- ✅ Add new family members
- ✅ View as Admin/Member toggle

### Member Users (Thomas, Evelyn, Theo)
- **Thomas:** `thomas@familyholdings.local` / `ThomasSawyer2024!`
- **Evelyn:** `evelyn@familyholdings.local` / `EvelynSawyer2024!`
- **Theo:** `theo@familyholdings.local` / `TheoSawyer2024!`
- **Access Level:** Limited member privileges

**Available Features:**
- ✅ View personal dashboard
- ✅ View personal contributions and loans
- ✅ Submit loan requests
- ✅ Update personal profile settings
- ❌ **NO ACCESS** to Family Overview management features
- ❌ **NO ACCESS** to manage other users
- ❌ **NO ACCESS** to admin functions

## Security Implementation

### Frontend Protection
1. **Authentication Helper** (`src/utils/auth-helper.js`)
   - Validates user credentials against family member database
   - Returns proper user role and permissions
   - Normalizes role values for consistency

2. **Role-Based Components**
   - Family Overview page checks `isAdmin(user)` before rendering
   - Manage buttons only visible to admin users
   - Add Family Member functionality restricted to admins
   - Navigation items filtered based on user role

3. **Access Control Functions**
   - `isAdmin(user)` - Check if user has admin privileges
   - `canManageUsers(user)` - Check if user can manage other users
   - `canAccessAdminFeatures(user)` - Check admin feature access
   - `getUserFeatures(user)` - Get available features by role

### Backend Protection
1. **Role Normalization** (`backend/dependencies.py`)
   - Handles both 'user' and 'member' role values from database
   - Normalizes to consistent 'member' role for non-admins
   - Maintains admin role distinction

2. **API Endpoint Protection**
   - Admin-only endpoints require `require_admin` dependency
   - User data access restricted to own data or admin access
   - Proper 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access

## Database Role Consistency
- **Users Table:** Contains roles 'admin' and 'user'
- **Profiles Table:** Contains roles 'admin' and 'member'
- **Backend:** Normalizes 'user' → 'member' for consistency
- **Frontend:** Uses 'admin' and 'member' consistently

## Access Control Verification

### When Admin (Will) is logged in:
- Can access Family Overview page
- Can see and use all Manage buttons
- Can add new family members
- Can view as Admin/Member toggle
- Has full navigation access

### When Member (Thomas/Evelyn/Theo) is logged in:
- Family Overview page shows "Admin Access Required" message
- No manage buttons visible
- No admin navigation items
- Limited to personal data and basic features
- Cannot access admin functions

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Log in as Admin:**
   ```
   Email: admin@familyholdings.local
   Password: WillSawyer2024!
   ```
   - Should see full Family Overview with manage buttons
   - Can access all admin features

2. **Log in as Member:**
   ```
   Email: thomas@familyholdings.local
   Password: ThomasSawyer2024!
   ```
   - Family Overview should show access denied
   - Only personal features available

## Technical Notes

- Role validation happens on both frontend and backend
- Authentication uses credential validation against family member database
- All API requests include proper user role headers
- Session management maintains user role throughout the application
- Graceful fallbacks for when backend is unavailable

This implementation ensures that **each login is truly independent** and **users cannot access admin features if their role is 'member'**.
